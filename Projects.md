# Possible projects to do

 - URL Shortener - Shortens URL and creates path that will redirect user to original URL
 - HTTP Server - Build from ground up, create a simple HTTP server, start with TCP server
    - Try different concurrency models - goroutines, threads, async/await -> Perf testing
 - Simple Web Crawler - Crawl a website and store the data in a database
 - Simple ChatBot - this should be easy, postgresql can run locally - store data + embeddings, same goes for the model
