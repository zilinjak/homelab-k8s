## Before It Started...

When I began working as a DevOps engineer at Košík.cz, I started using Kubernetes daily for the first time. I quickly realized I had basically no clue how it worked or how to properly manage it. After reading many blogs and exploring Kubernetes for about a year, I noticed much of the setup had been done by my colleagues. 

I decided to buy a **Raspberry Pi 5 8GB** and start my own homelab where I would set up an entire Kubernetes cluster myself. My goal was to gain fundamental knowledge about core components of cloud computing.
